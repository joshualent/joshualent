Svelte is a javascript/typescript framework for building reactive frontends. Svelte uses [signals](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) so that when your state variables change, your ui reflects the latest data. In a svelte component, you can define javascript in a script tag, define your html, and sprinkle javascript into your markup by surrounding it with brackets `{myJsVar}`.

Svelte defines special template syntax for conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`) and iterating over a variable (`each`).

SvelteKit is a metaframework for building full apps using svelte (similar to Next.js for React). It provides routing, URL parameters, cookies, form actions, "server actions", etc. for creating fullstack apps.
