## About Me

Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a student learning about computer science and web development. I'm a novice web developer looking to share my journey as I learn more and improve. I hope my some of my knowledge can be valuable to others, but first, a bit about me.

<!-- truncate-->

I really like the web. I don't know why specifically, but it is just pretty cool to me. I remember wanting to make desktop applications when I got started programming, which I think was mostly because it was the first thing I start of, but also likely because of the graphical element. I think that the web is an interesting place and I enjoy interacting with it and the technologies that power it. Whether that means building tools that run on the web, desktop apps with Electron, or hacking web-apps as a penetration tester, I look forward to sharing it!

## Programming History

My first introduction to programming was using C++ in a brief summer camp. I remember forgetting the semicolons a lot and trying but being unable to solve a pyramid generating challenge which required nested for loops.

After the camp ended, I found out about the Unity game engine and that I could make my own games. This sounded appealing to me and I found the Brackeys YouTube channel and other resources from Microsoft and Unity to learn how to make games using C#. If you are wondering why I didn't use Unreal Engine, this is a good point to mention that I wasn't good at writing C++. and it turns out I didn't become good at writing C# either. I had some great tutorials to follow, but it turns out I wasn't really understanding how things actually worked and relied heavily on tutorials. I was able to write the basic C# syntax at least, but I wasn't good at programming, especially not using the many Unity specific classes and functions which existed outside of my basic C# knowledge.

Later on, I was lucky enough to take AP Computer Science using Java. I breezed through the first weeks of class off my C# expereince, but soon enough I found myself being challenged. I was learning a lot about the code writing process, Programming Logic, and OOP. I took the AP test, secured a 5, and then stepped away from Java.

## Introduction to the web

In an attempt to keep myself occupied as a anti-social nerd who kept to himself, I ended up discovering freeCodeCamp, a phenomenal resource for learning how to code. I followed their Responsive Web Design curriculum and enjoyed making things with HTML & CSS. I started writing code on my own machine using VSCode and worked on a few basic things for a while.

If it seems like I am jumping around a lot and skipping undisclosed amounts of time, it is because I have been very inconsistent in my programming journey. As a dedicated student, I have found that I work well with the strucuture of a curriculum, especially when external forces like a teacher and grades are there to keep me honest. That's not to say that I can't be self motivated, as I would consider many of the things I know now to be the result of curiosity that fueled major learning milestones, but a classroom setting can really help motivate me and keep me on track. In my second semester of college, I took a PE class where the I learned to work out and was kept accountable. Though thrice-weekly weightlifting, some cardio sessions, and a strict calorie counting plan, I ended up losing over 50 pounds in the course of 6 months.

The following semester, I was able to take my first Computer Science courses, which included a Webpage coding class. The first weeks of class on HTML and CSS were stuff I was already familiar with from freeCodeCamp. With a head start on picking up the material, I worked ahead on the projects and made a nifty site about frogs and a stylish registration form. As I gained rapport with the instructor, I learned about the existence of JavaScript. I came back to freeCodeCamp and began their JavaScript curriculum. I picked up JavaScript on the side as I continued this and another class about Introduction to Programming Logic using Python.

## Present day

In the present, I have continued to program in JavaScript and Python. I enjoy the versatility of Python for just about everything except fronted web development, and JavaScript for filing that gap. That isn't at all to discredit JavaScript, as I think it has a solid place in the world of web development, including being used across the stack. I can't see not having a use for JavaScript, but I find that I still like using Python with the Django framework and to explore other programming areas like automation, data analytics, and Cybersecurity.

Going forward, I think it is a good time to settle into the technologies I already know. Over the summer, my goal project is to make a Single-Page App using Django Rest Framework and React with TypeScript. If you would like to read more about my journey of connecting Django with React and learning TypeScript, stick around as I will be writing about the journey and some documentation. Further down the line, I look forward to trying Next.js with it's interesting full-stack approach and it's consistency of one language across the stack.

As for now, I will be continue to program and make things for the web. As my projects progress, look forward to updates in both my documentation and this blog.

Cya,
Josh
