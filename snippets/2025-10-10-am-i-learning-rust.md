I've been curious about programming languages for a while. I just like programming and I find most of it fascinating. I tried a little bit of Golang a few months back, but other than that I've been pretty consistently using Python and a bit of TypeScript. Recently, the language I've been curious about is Rust. And I made the move to start learning it.

Rust just looked really cool and made me want to try it out. I ended up doing that on Wednesday where I was procrastinating studying for an upcoming calc exam so I stumbled upon some Rust content on YouTube and started reading the Rust book. I spent a while reading and taking notes on [a great intro to rust article](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust) as a primer for what I would learn from the Rust book. After a long time of reading and jotting things down, I started to think about where I would use Rust, but I couldn't think of anything.

I'm a growing software developer looking to specialize in web development. Most of my experience is with Django and some fun side projects using JavaScript (recently TypeScript) and React. I don't see me switching over to a framework like [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and I can't really see myself going into systems programming. I'm still new to programming and not likely to be contributing open source projects using Rust (idk I might be more of a hinderance than help). So, what is the reason to learn Rust.

I've realized my main (and pretty much only) reason is that it looks interesting and I think I'll learn new things and have some fun doing it. And that's pretty much it.

And now I have to choose if "it looks cool" is a good enough reason. I've been trying to do that listening to content (and continuing the book to see if I get to a point where I need to bow out).  It was actually a video [Why you shouldn't learn Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOFWIvNowXo) by [Theo - t3.gg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) that made me realize that my main reason was that it looked fun: "If you don't have these (performance) problems, the only learn and adopt Rust is for fun. ... Rust is a great language."

So, what's my decision. Honestly it feels pretty great to admit that's pretty much my only reason to learn Rust right now is because I want to try using it and see how it feels. It also helped when I mentioned learning Rust to a great CS Professor and he mentioned that it looked cool but he was too busy to try it.

Against all odds, I still have a spark and a will to learn Rust. It might be a weird, but when I keep looking into languages I just start to see that a lot of things come down to personal preference on whether people like languages.

Right now I'm going through Ch 4: Ownership and it's pretty dense stuff, but I'm not as deterred and still excited to be able to keep up with it. I do actually have to put it on the backburner so I don't fail my calc exam, but I will be looking forward to it and still trying to sneak in time for it when I can.
