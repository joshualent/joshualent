Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a software developer and CS nerd very curious about web development. I like trying new things and starting new projects, most of which can be found here on GitHub. I really enjoy working with Django and server stuff, but still prioritize a good user experience.

I am working towards a bachelor's degree in CS and looking for a career in web development. I'm quite interested in advancements in web development from the new rendering strategies in Next.js, libraries like [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org/) pushing [LoB](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/), and other cool web tools like [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/) which impact how I build for the web.

I've dabled with JS/TS, but my favorite language to use is Python, especially with new tools like [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) from [astral-sh](https://github.com/astral-sh)
