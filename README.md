Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a software developer and CS nerd very curious about web development. I like trying new things and starting a new projects, most of which can be found here on GitHub. I really enjoy working with Django and the MVC/MVT pattern, but I also have experience with TypeScript and React. 

I am working towards a bachelor's degree in CS and looking for a career in web development. I'm quite interested in advancements in web development from the new rendering strategies in Next.js, libraries like [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org/) pushing [LoB](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/), and other cool web things like [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) and [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/).
