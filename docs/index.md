Here is my personal documentation about programming and web development.

I've wanted my own wiki ever since I heard of [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), the open source documentation platform powering [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki). Stick around and you might just find docs on the following:

- **DevOps** - Linux, Git, Docker, Application deployment, etc.
- **Programming (with Python)** - Programming and Python notes
- **Django** - Everything Django
- **System Design** - web architecture + backend + database notes
- **Misc** - Web security, Web history, and some (software-related) business notes
