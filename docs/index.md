Here is my personal documentation about programming and web development.

I've wanted my own wiki ever since I heard of [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), the open source documentation platform powering [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki). Stick around and you might just find helpful notes on the following:

- **[DevOps](devops)** - Linux, Git, Docker, Application deployment, etc.
- **[Programming (with Python)](programming)** - Programming and Python notes
- **[Django](django)** - Everything Django
- **[System Design](systems)** - web architecture + backend + database notes
- **[Misc](misc)** - Web security, Web history, and some (software-related) business notes
